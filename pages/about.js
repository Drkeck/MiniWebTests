            <h1>Hello there</h1>
            <p>This is my first time ever using next.js and i was curious to see how it works in action.</p>
            <p>honestly how this whole thing works is a little weird but at the same time its also way more straight forward than base React and since this is also a server implimentation you are able to use specific things here like being able to build api end points that will link into databases</p>
            <p>and all of this is just lightning fast</p>
        </div>

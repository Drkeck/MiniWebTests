            <h1>Hello there</h1>
            <p>This is my first time ever using next.js and i was curious to see how it works in action.</p>
            <p>honestly how this whole thing works is a little weird but at the same time its also way more straight forward than base React and since this is also a server implimentation you are able to use specific things here like being able to build api end points that will link into databases</p>
            <p>and all of this is just lightning fast</p>
            <p>I am going to make this a little thing i do on the side to keep my skill up, i think im going to use this to develop my personal &quot;with frinds&ldquo; site use the password system to give them out and build useful stuff for them like a character sheet generator</p>
            <p>who knows what i&apos;ll be up to here but it will be fun making it and trying to get something to work.</p>
            <p>plus since this is both react and js i can keep my skills up.</p>
        </div>
